## Domain: Retails
## Model Stage: Functional
### We have built a Deep Learning Model using 2 approaches for classifying Clothing Assests and compare the accuracy of both the models:
* Approach:1--> Using traditional approach i.e. not using Convolution and Pooling layers
* Approach:2--> Using Convolution and Pooling layers
