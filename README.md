# Improved_ComputerVision_with_CNN
### We are going to build Deep Learning Model using 2 approaches and compare the accuracy of both the models with respect to each other:
* Approach:1--> Using traditional approach i.e. not using Convolution and Pooling layers
* Approach:2--> Using Convolution and Pooling layers
