# Project_Improved_ComputerVisio_with_CNN
The project is the demonstration of building the Convolution Neural Network from scratch and compared its accuracy over simple Neural Network.   
I performed some experimentations with CNN by twicking its parameters and monitor its impact on Accuracy and Training time.
